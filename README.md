# Enhance-calculator
Enhance calculator is based on the Black Desert video game enhancing simulator for gear upgrading. 
It calculates the chance in percentage plus the number of failing attempts( also in percentage depending on gear level)
then it simulates an animation of upgrading the gear 
and either it fails or success depending on the rolling dice total.
